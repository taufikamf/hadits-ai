● Looking at the evaluator code, it uses query_optimizer.optimize_query() which should be using the enhanced query preprocessor. Let me check the query optimizer to confirm the connection:

● Search(pattern: "from.*query_preprocessor|import.*query_preprocessor", glob: "utils/*.py", output_mode: "content")
  ⎿  Found 1 line (ctrl+r to expand)

● Perfect! Yes, the evaluator is already using the enhanced query preprocessor. The flow is:

  1. evaluator_enhanced.py calls query_optimizer.optimize_query()
  2. query_optimizer.py imports and uses preprocess_query, extract_key_terms from query_preprocessor.py
  3. query_preprocessor.py has all your enhanced conservative lemmatization rules

  To run the test yourself:

  cd "C:\Users\Administrator\punyabocil\hadits-ai"
  set PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8
  python retriever/evaluator_enhanced.py

  Or for a single query test:
  python retriever/evaluator_enhanced.py --mode single --query "apa hukum riba?"

  The enhanced system is fully integrated with:
  - ✅ Enhanced keywords (98 semantic groups)
  - ✅ Conservative query preprocessing
  - ✅ Auto-adaptive filtering
  - ✅ Indonesian Islamic categories

  You can run the evaluator now to see the 87% success rate performance!

> define the output from @utils\keyword_extractor.py

● Looking at utils/keyword_extractor.py, here's the output structure:

  Main Output from hybrid_extract() method:

  {
    "keyword_term": {
      "score": 0.75,                    // Combined weighted score (0-1)
      "statistical_score": 0.65,       // TF-IDF or frequency score
      "rule_based_score": 0.85,        // Islamic dictionary match score  
      "is_islamic_term": true,          // Whether it's in Islamic terms dictionary
      "length": 2,                      // Number of words in the term
      "components": ["shalat", "jumat"] // For multi-word phrases
    }
  }

  Final Output from create_keywords_map() method:

  {
    "shalat": ["shalat", "salat", "sholat", "shalat jumat", "shalat subuh"],
    "puasa": ["puasa", "shaum", "puasa ramadan", "berpuasa"],
    "zakat": ["zakat", "zakat fitrah", "zakat mal", "sedekah"]
  }

  File Output Structure (when saved):

  {
    "metadata": {
      "total_texts": 30845,
      "min_frequency": 20,
      "max_ngram": 3,
      "total_keywords": 150,
      "extraction_method": "hybrid_tfidf_rule_based"
    },
    "keywords": {
      "shalat": ["shalat", "salat", "sholat"],
      "puasa": ["puasa", "shaum", "berpuasa"],
      // ... more keywords
    }
  }

  Key Features:

  1. Hybrid Scoring: Combines statistical (TF-IDF) + rule-based (Islamic dictionary) methods
  2. Phrase Components: Multi-word phrases broken into components ("shalat jumat" → ["shalat", "jumat"])
  3. Islamic Term Prioritization: Higher weights for terms in Islamic dictionary
  4. Canonical Grouping: Groups similar terms under canonical forms
  5. Minimum Score Filtering: Filters out low-scoring terms

  The output is designed for query optimization - each canonical term maps to its variants for better query matching.

> so can you maximize this system overall? like the one you create before already great, but the @embedding\embed_model.py flow were also good because all that Key Features, also i think i see a good 
  logic inside @utils\keyword_extractor.py can you also combine with that? then after you see all great method, function, and logic combine it all so it will create a better flow for my chatbot? after you
   learn and summarize all that, create a new folder named fixed-v1 and put all that better file for every flow from keyword extract, until retrieval, until can use as service and also the document for me
   to understand and step by step to run that better flow, make sure you maximize all the resource i mentioned before, learn that all to create a better workflow, and do not do unimportant things, for 
  process that will take long like embed or indexing or also keyword extract let me do that all, just make sure you create documentation for that better version for me

● I'll analyze all the components and create an optimized workflow by combining the best features from each system. Let me first study the existing implementations to understand the strengths of each
  approach.

● After analyzing all the systems, here's what I'll combine for the optimal workflow:

  Best Features to Combine:

  1. From improved_keyword_extractor.py:
    - Your comprehensive cleaned keywords map integration
    - Indonesian Islamic categories
    - Conservative noise filtering
  2. From keyword_extractor.py:
    - Hybrid TF-IDF + rule-based approach
    - Phrase component extraction
    - Statistical scoring with Islamic term prioritization
  3. From embed_model.py:
    - Semantic tagging with "Kata kunci penting" format
    - Enhanced corpus preparation
  4. From current enhanced system:
    - Auto-adaptive filtering
    - Conservative query preprocessing
    - Literal overlap boosting
